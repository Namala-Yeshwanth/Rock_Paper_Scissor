# Rock_Paper_Scissor
This project is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to play against the computer in a series of rounds where they choose between rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner of each round is determined based on the game's traditional rules:

* Rock crushes Scissors
* Scissors cuts Paper
* Paper covers Rock

The game keeps track of the user's score and displays the outcome of each round dynamically on the webpage. The project also includes responsive design elements to ensure it works well on various screen sizes.


### Key Features:
* User Interaction: Players select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on corresponding buttons.
* Game Logic: JavaScript handles the game's logic, determining the winner of each round based on the choices made by the player and the computer.
* Score Tracking: The score is updated and displayed after each round to keep track of the user's performance.


### Future Enhancements:
Potential future enhancements include:

* Adding more sophisticated animations and transitions.
* Implementing additional game modes or options.
* Improving accessibility features for a wider audience.


Feel free to play the game live here and explore the source code on GitHub. Your feedback and suggestions are welcome!
